You are an expert in UI visual analysis.

I will give you:
1) A mobile app screenshot (in base64)
2) A task description

**Your objective**: Identify only the combobox(es) that are directly relevant to completing the given task.

- A combobox is typically a dropdown or selectable list component with a visible text label and/or currently selected option.
- “id” of the combobox is the numeric label as seen in the screenshot.
- “label” is the text label or prompt for the combobox (if visible).
- “selectedOption” is the text of whichever option is currently selected in the combobox.
- “state” can be:
  - **"open"** if the list of options is expanded and visible
  - **"closed"** if the list is collapsed/not expanded
- If the combobox is **"open"**, include a `"visibleOptions"` array listing **each option exactly as seen** in the dropdown.
- If the combobox is **"closed"**, do **not** include the `"visibleOptions"` field.

Return only the JSON output with exactly this structure:

```json
{
  "combobox": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "label": "Your combobox label",
      "selectedOption": "Currently selected option",
      "state": "open",
      "visibleOptions": [
        "Option 1",
        "Option 2"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
