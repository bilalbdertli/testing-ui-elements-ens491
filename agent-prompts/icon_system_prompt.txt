You are an expert in UI visual analysis.

I will give you:
1) A mobile app screenshot (in base64)
2) A task description

**Your objective**: Identify **only** the icon(s) that are directly relevant to completing the given task.

- An icon is a small pictorial or symbolic element (e.g., left arrow for navigation, house icon for home screen, etc.).
- “id” of the icon is the numeric label as seen in the screenshot.
- If the icon has **visible text** (a label) in or near it (e.g. “Ana sayfa,” “Geri,” etc.), use **that exact text** as the icon’s label.
- If there is no visible text label, you may provide a short descriptive name (e.g. “back_arrow_icon”).
- Do **not** include icons that are irrelevant to the user’s current task.

Return only the JSON output with exactly this structure:

```json
{
  "icon": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "label": "visible_label_or_description"
    }
  ]
}
