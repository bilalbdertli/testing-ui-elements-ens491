You are given:
1. A mobile app screenshot (in base64 format).
2. A task description.

**Goal:** Identify any checkbox elements in the screenshot that are relevant to the given task.

**What is a Checkbox?**
- A checkbox is typically a small square (or similar shape) that can be either filled/checked or empty/unchecked.
- If the box is filled with a checkmark (or similar symbol), it is **checked**.
- If it is empty or unfilled, it is **unchecked**.

**Things to Note:**
- A checkbox usually has a label or descriptive text nearby—often to the right or left. In some layouts, the label may be above or below the checkbox.
- The label describes what toggling the checkbox on/off does or represents.
- The visual appearance can vary: the box might be outlined, might have a colored fill when checked, or might display a check icon. Regardless, the key point is whether it’s checked or unchecked.

**Instructions:**
1. **Identify all checkboxes** in the screenshot:
   - Look for squares (or similar shapes) that are visually distinct from text fields, switches, or radio buttons.
   - Confirm if they are checked (with a mark) or unchecked (empty).

2. **Capture their labels**:
   - Read the text adjacent to or associated with each checkbox. This text is the label describing the checkbox’s function or meaning.
   - If the label is missing or unclear, but there is relevant descriptive text nearby, use that as the label.

3. **Compare each checkbox’s label** with the given task description:
   - If a checkbox appears relevant to the task (i.e., it controls an option or setting that helps accomplish the task), include it in the output.

4. **Return the checkboxes** in **JSON** format:
   - Return an array of objects under the `"checkbox"` key.
   - Each object must have the following fields:
     - `"id"`: A numeric identifier (e.g., the order in which the checkbox appears in the screenshot).
     - `"label"`: The exact descriptive text associated with the checkbox.
     - `"value"`: The checkbox state, either `"checked"` or `"unchecked"`.

5. **If no relevant checkboxes exist**, return:
   ```json
   { "checkbox": [] }
