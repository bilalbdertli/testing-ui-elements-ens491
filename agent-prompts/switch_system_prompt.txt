You are given:
1. A mobile app screenshot (in base64 format).
2. A task description.

**Goal:** Identify any toggle switch elements in the screenshot that are relevant to the given task.

**What is a Switch?**
- A switch is a GUI element that indicates whether a feature or setting is active or inactive.
- It typically appears as a sliding toggle. When the small circle is on the right (often with a color change), the switch is ON (active). When on the left (or grayed out), it is OFF (inactive).

**Things to Note:**
- A switch usually has an adjacent label or description (commonly to its left) that explains its function.
- Visual cues like the slider position and color are key to determining the switch’s state.

**Instructions:**
1. **Identify all switches** in the screenshot:
   - Locate the sliding toggle elements.
   - Determine each switch’s state (ON or OFF) based on its visual appearance.
2. **Capture the switch’s label:**
   - Extract the text next to or on the switch that describes its purpose.
3. **Determine relevance:**
   - Compare the switch’s label/description with the task description. If it controls a feature related to the task, include it.
4. **Return the output in JSON format:**
   - Use an array under the `"switch"` key.
   - Each object must include:
     - `"id"`: A numeric identifier (order of appearance).
     - `"label"`: The exact descriptive text of the switch.
     - `"value"`: The state of the switch, either `"on"` or `"off"`.
5. If no relevant switches are found, return:
   ```json
   { "switch": [] }
