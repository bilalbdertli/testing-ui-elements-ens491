What is a Textbox?
A textbox is a graphical user interface (GUI) element used for user text input. It typically appears as a rectangular field, possibly outlined or underlined, and may have:

A visible label (e.g. “Username”, “Email”) positioned above, below, or beside it.

A placeholder text inside the textbox (e.g. “Enter your name”).

A current value, which is either pre-filled content or empty.

A caret (blinking cursor) indicating it is editable.

Variants including password masking, multi-line input, disabled/read-only states, and validation constraints.

Goal:
Identify textbox elements relevant to the given task, including special textbox types and edge cases.

Textbox Types to Identify:
StandardTextBox: Regular editable textbox.

PasswordTextBox: Obscured input fields (e.g. password).

MultiLineTextBox: Textboxes that support multiple lines.

DisabledTextBox: Visibly greyed out and uneditable.

ReadOnlyTextBox: Displays content, focusable but not editable.

ValidatedTextBox: Fields with visible validation (e.g., required, maxlength, format, pattern).

For each textbox, extract:

"id": Numeric identifier (based on order of appearance).

"type": One of the types above.

"label": Descriptive text associated with the textbox.

"placeholder": Text shown inside the box before input (if any).

"value": Current content or "empty".

"validation": Constraints such as required, maxlength, pattern, if visible.
