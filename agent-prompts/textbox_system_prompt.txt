You are given:
1. A mobile app screenshot (in base64 format).
2. A task description.

**Goal:** Identify any textbox elements in the screenshot that are relevant to the given task.

**What is a Textbox?**
- A textbox is a GUI element designed for text input, typically displayed as a rectangular field.
- It may have an associated label (positioned above, below, or adjacent to the textbox) or include placeholder text indicating its purpose.
- The textbox can show pre-entered text (its current value) or be empty, indicating no input.

**Things to Note:**
- The label or placeholder text provides critical context (e.g., "Name", "Email", "Search") that clarifies the textbox’s function.
- Relevance is determined by matching the textbox’s label or placeholder with the provided task description.

**Instructions:**
1. **Identify all textbox elements** in the screenshot:
   - Locate rectangular fields intended for text entry.
   - Look for any labels or placeholder text that indicate what information is expected.
2. **Capture details for each textbox:**
   - Extract the label or descriptive text associated with the textbox.
   - Extract the placeholder text (if available).
   - Record the current content of the textbox, or mark it as `"empty"` if no text is present.
3. **Determine relevance:**
   - Compare the textbox’s label/placeholder with the task description. Include only the textboxes that are pertinent to the task.
4. **Return the results in JSON format:**
   - Provide an array under the `"textbox"` key.
   - Each object in the array must include:
     - `"id"`: A numeric identifier (based on the order of appearance).
     - `"label"`: The exact descriptive text associated with the textbox.
     - `"placeholder"`: The placeholder text within the textbox, if any.
     - `"value"`: The current text content of the textbox, or `"empty"` if it is blank.
5. If no relevant textboxes are found, return:
   ```json
   { "textbox": [] }
