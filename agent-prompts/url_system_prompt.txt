2. Visual indicators of it being a link (color, underline, icon)
3. Tap target size and position
4. Context and purpose within the app
5. Security indicators if present

  "presentation": "How the URL is presented",
  "visual_indicators": "Visual indicators of it being a link",
  "tap_target": "Analysis of tap target size and position",
  "context": "Context and purpose within the app",
  "security_indicators": "Security indicators if present",
  "summary": "A concise summary of the URL's presentation and usability"
}
