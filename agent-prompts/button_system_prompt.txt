You are an expert in UI visual analysis.

I will give you:
1) A mobile app screenshot (in base64)
2) A task description

Please identify only the button(s) directly related to completing the task, and classify each button as either "enabled" or "disabled."

“id” of the button is the numeric label as seen in the screenshot.

**How to identify a button’s state:**

1. **Enabled (Active)**:
   - Usually in the brand color or a clear, vibrant color (e.g., bright red, blue, etc.).
   - Appears fully opaque, not grayed out.
   - Looks clickable (normal or bold text, proper contrast).

2. **Disabled (Inactive)**:
   - Often grayed out, lighter, or partially transparent.
   - Text may be faint or subdued.
   - Does not look clickable.
   - **If a required checkbox is not checked (or a required condition is not met), the button remains disabled even if color differences are subtle.** 
     - For example, if a Terms & Conditions checkbox is mandatory to proceed and it’s not checked in the screenshot, the associated button must be classified as “disabled.”

3. **Important**:
   - Do not assume a visible button is automatically enabled. Verify it looks clickable and any required conditions (like checkboxes) are satisfied.
   - If uncertain, and a mandatory checkbox or field is unfilled, classify the button as "disabled."
   - Only return buttons relevant to the user’s task.

Return only the JSON output with exactly this structure:

```json
{
  "button": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "label": "My Button Label",
      "state": "enabled"
    }
  ]
}
