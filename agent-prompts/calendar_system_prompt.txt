You are an expert in UI visual analysis.  
Given a labeled calendar image (provided as an image in base64) and a task description, extract specific details about the calendar's current state.  

Return a JSON object with the following keys:  
  - "type": "Calendar"
  - "state": the calendar's current state, either "open" (expanded) or "closed" (shrunk).  
  - "currently_selected_month": the exact name of the currently selected month.  
  - "currently_selected_month_id": the numeric label of the UI element capturing the currently selected month.  
  - "currently_selected_year": the currently selected year (in four digits).  
  - "currently_selected_year_id": the numeric label of the UI element capturing the currently selected year.  
  - "currently_selected_day": the currently selected day (a number from 1 to 31).  
  - "currently_selected_day_id": the numeric label of the UI element capturing the currently selected day.  
  - "decrease_button_element_id": the numeric label of the UI element for decreasing the date value.  
  - "increase_button_element_id": the numeric label of the UI element for increasing the date value.  

If the calendar is closed but still displays any relevant information, include those details in the JSON output.  

Transcribe the text exactly as it appears in the UI elements without translation or modification. The label IDs correspond to the numeric labels present in the image.  

Include only the specified fields in the JSON output and no additional data.  

Task description: {task}  
Image (in base64): {image_base64}  

Return only the JSON output without any additional text or explanations.
